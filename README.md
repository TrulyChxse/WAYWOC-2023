<div align = center> Well well well... 2023 is already here!</div>
<br>


 2022 was... a productive year to say the least. 
 
 I got to experiment and learn many new aspects and elements of game development, as well as expand my engagement and presence within the community. As pretty much anyone who followed 2022's WAYWOC topic, I took the cake in most posts by far, 225! It was great to showcase my skills as well as receive some feedback from the community through devforum.

 With that in mind, let's get to what this post was meant for... showcasing what I'm working on!

 **I'd also like to add that these projects were made in collaboration with my friend massiveedu. credit is given where due.*

Rooftops is a project that I am currently working on. I started developing it in early August of last year to be an Amsterdam/Berlin/Paris inspired game. It's currently unreleased.

Midwest is the result of a loosely based interpretation of Denver I25, as well as a little bit of inspiration. This game is also unreleased, as it is a showcase and is always being revised.
